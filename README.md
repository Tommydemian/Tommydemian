### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github portfolio! My name is Tomas Gil amoedo 👨‍💻 and I am a skilled Full-Stack developer from Argentina 🚀 with almost 3 years of experience in building high-quality web applications 💻. I specialize in React.js, React native [plain and expo], and Vuejs. I also have experience with Nodejs 🎨.

I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript ( specially ), Node | Express and TypeScript 💡, .

One of my recent/current achievements is leading a React Native project with +500 active users.

problem-solving skills and technical communication are the core skills for success as a developer. I am constantly striving to deepen my understanding of how things work under the hood, as I believe this is crucial for effective communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Continual learning is a passion of mine, and I make it a priority to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and techniques in the field.

I am a team player and I have experience working with Agile development methodologies and version control systems like Git 🔎. I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my skills and deliver high-quality code 🔎.
