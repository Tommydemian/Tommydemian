### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github portfolio! My name is Tomas Gil amoedo 👨‍💻 and I am a passionate front-end developer from Argentina 🚀 with over a year of experience in building high-quality web applications 💻. I specialize in React.js and have experience with other frameworks such as Vue.js 🎨.

I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript 💡, and I am skilled in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. I have a keen eye for detail and I am committed to delivering pixel-perfect designs 🧐.

One of my recent achievements was implementing end-to-end testing using Cypress throughout the entire application at Red Padel USA 🔎, where I currently work as a Frontend Developer.

While I appreciate the importance of UI design, I am more passionate about logical problem-solving and conflict resolution 🤔. I am more focused on being a frontend developer with knowledge of backend and a macro view of the application 🤝. I am known for my versatility and ability to approach problems with a critical thinking mindset 🚀. My experience in problem-solving allows me to identify and resolve complex issues in a timely and efficient manner, making me a valuable asset to any team 💻.

I am a team player and I have experience working with Agile development methodologies and version control systems like Git 🔎. I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my skills and deliver high-quality code 🔎.
