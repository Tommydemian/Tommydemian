### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Tomas Gil Amoedo 👨‍💻, a dedicated Full-Stack Developer from Argentina 🚀 with nearly 3 years of hands-on experience in crafting high-quality web applications 💻. I specialize in React.js, React Native (including both plain and Expo), and Vue.js, enriched by my proficiency with Node.js 🎨.

I possess a firm foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (particularly), Node | Express, and TypeScript 💡. I value problem-solving skills and technical communication as central to a developer's success. Delving into the intricacies of technology underpins my ability to effectively interface with technical and non-technical audiences alike.

A current project showcasing my depth as a developer is SFIDO, a React Native App I'm developing on my own leading a worlwide team with people from USA, Italy and Singapur. The public GitHub repository stands as a testament to my coding practices and user-focused design approach.

I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and consistently strive to stay abreast of the latest technologies and methodologies. As a team-oriented professional, I have thrived in Agile environments and am well-versed in version control with Git 🔎.

Feel free to delve into my repositories to gauge the quality and breadth of my work. If you're on the lookout for a diligent developer who brings both fervor and versatility to the table, let's connect!
